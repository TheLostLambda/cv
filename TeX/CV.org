/The Grand 2019 CV Rewrite/

* General Approach
I'll create a dynamic CV. I'm going to think of everything that I've ever done /
made / been awarded that I'm proud of, and I'll flesh out the details. I'll
include a one-line summary (probably the section title), when and where it was,
what I did (what type of experience), and what I gained from the experience
(specific skills and general reflection). Wherever possible, I should link some
tangible proof.

I'll sort these CV items into general categories based on the skills they
demonstrate, and when it comes time to share my CV on an application, I'll take
only the most relevant categories and selectively reduce (to the one-line) the
less relevant experiences, to highlight the most relevant ones. This way I can
produce a CV tailored to a particular application without needing to write
anything new or creating conflicting versions.

Scanning the literature, I stockpiled information regarding the
post-translational modification and trafficking of proteins. From this body of
research, I picked out the most important points to be presented as part of the
poster — striking the balance between rigour and brevity.
***** Skills
  - Selected key points from a large body of research
  - Demonstrated a competency in graphical design

FTC teams used to be forced to choose between two programming toolchains: either
a 5GB+ install and minute-long programming cycles, or an under-featured
web-interface prone to code loss. By reverse engineering the web protocol,
FTC\_HTTP allows wireless development from any text-editor, on any platform, in
less than 8MB.
***** Skills
  - Reverse engineered an undocumented protocol
  - Created a polished, cross-platform application

** Hobbies & Interests
I'm into things that byte. When I'm not programming or fiddling with one of my
computers, I treat myself myself to some video games. I've built the desktop
computer that I play games on and have helped a number of others do the
same. Since coming to Uni, I've also developed an interest in cybersecurity and
have joined the Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers.

Aside from computers, I've recently taken up photography. I can't draw to save
my life, but I think I've gotten rather good at stealing art from
nature. Photography for me is a fun blend of technical knowledge and artistic
challenge.

Finally, I love to read and to write. I often end up doing lots of technical
reading as a consequence of my computer science hobby, but certainly enjoy an
awful Fantasy novel when I can find the time for it.

** Feedback
 - The education section could benefit from some structure. The weighted
   average and University bits are a bit ambiguous. They are on the same level
   as St Bedes College. Did you score St. Beades, or attend an average?
 - Use a single hyphen for date ranges (-) not an em dash (—)?
 - Currently flows well when you read everything in a section, but might help
   to categorise things. Like having all of the skills from an experience in
   one place, all of the responsibilities, etc. I might be chatting rubbish though
 - Titles of the positions, the "2019 Sales Representative, Annotated Studios"
   would benefit from a bolding or underline. They are hard to pick out at a
   glance (they can look like a wrapped bullet-point)
 - Global Engineering challenge is inconsistent with things like Student
   Ambassador, the description isn't part of a bullet like most other details
 - "Staff the help desk" should be "Staffed the help desk?"
 - ‘palyable city’ -> playable city?
 - Space between Mobile number and colon? "Mobile:07..." -> "Mobile: 07...
 - Missing apostrophe in "This years project is to organize and deliver a
   public...", should be "This year's..."
 - The bold thing for skills is really good. I suppose that less is more for
   applications, so everything on the CV should be relevant and justified. This
   is done well overall, but places like "2017, Lourdes Volunteer" could be cut
   in some cases, giving you more words for the more relevant volunteering
   experiences.
 - "help work on the prototypes and" Capitalise "Help"
 - Formatting-wise, Science Alive is a little lonely (title in one column,
   everything else in the second)
 - Probably a couple more small things, I would focus on some proof-reading and
   consistency, but overall a very good CV. Lots of experience that is well
   explained and impressive.
 - Pick a sharp and easy to read font
